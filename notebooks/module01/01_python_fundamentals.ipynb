    "\n",
    "Python is the name of a programming language created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the early 1990s, and it is one of many, many programming languages available. Python is a very robust and very popular language, which is why we have chosen to learn it on our course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **general purpose programming language**. This means that it can be used in a wide range of settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become arguably the main programming language used for data science and machine learning. One of the most common ways to run Python - in general, but specifically when conducting data-driven work - is with a **Jupyter Notebook**. This is what we are interacting with right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is powerful because it allows a user to use **cells** to interact with the programming language. These cells allow you to run blocks of code one at a time, increasing the interactivity. You can also have other types of cells, like Markdown cells (this one) which improves readability. The combination of code and Markdown cells makes Jupyter Notebooks a powerful tool for creating data-driven narratives. Code is the vehicle we use to make our ideas \"go\", via the \"kernel\" (the computational engine that runs the code). Markdown is used to organize our work and research narrative. This text is essential to introduce the reader/audience to the problem or topic being investigated, our research question/hypothesis, materials and methods, results, discussion, and conclusions. \n",

    "\n",
    "In a real life database management system, it would be much more probable that there was a variable called something like `egg_count`, which tells us the *number* of eggs in stock, rather than simply *whether* there are eggs or not. If that number is 0, there are no eggs, if it's 1 or more, then there are eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need a way to **compare** values (in this case an integer number of eggs) to evaluate to `True` or `False`. This is where the python [comparison operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm) come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are like arithmetic operators, in that they take the value on the left, and compare it to the value on the right, and then, depending on the result of the comparison, return `True` or `False`. We can either assign the boolean value to a variable, or, more commonly, just pass the condition to `if`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the simplest of all these operators to understand is `==`, the **equality** operator. Note the two equals signs, this is intentional, as it means python can understand the different between **assignment** and **equality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is an example which uses both the assignment operator and the equality operator."
