    "## Preprocessing Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One type of data that we often work with is text data. This includes social media posts, novels, customer reviews, or interview transcripts. Text is a powerful source of information, but requires specific preprocessing in order to be used in machine learning contexts. In particular, machine learning algorithms are designed to work with numbers, so the end goal of text preprocessing is to have numeric features associated with each text in the dataset. In this notebook we will go over a preprocessing **pipeline** (or series of sequential steps) for text, which is the first step that we need to take in order to analyze text using our data science techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help you: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read, manipulate, and write .csv files in a Pandas Dataframe;\n",
    "2. Preprocess text with the following key skills: tokenizing, stopword removal, N-grams extraction, and lemmatization using spaCy;\n",
    "\n",
    "In module 1, you completed an introduction to Python fundamentals, including the basics of the Pandas package, which we will use extensively in this notebook. The present module is designed to accelerate your coding skills so that you can use Python effectively for generating research results. However, if you have less experience with Python, some of this will be overwhelming. That's totally normal, since it takes more than a couple of hours to learn how to code! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feeling overwhelmed, it can be helpful to focus on the broader purpose of the functions in the notebook for now and how we can use them to further our research purposes, rather than the details of the algorithms to cold. It can also help to remember that you don't need to memorize every function you want to use. Even programmers who have been working with Python for years will regularly refer to documentation and resources (like this notebook!) while they are developing a project. With time and experience as you progress through the notebooks you will get more comfortable with the Python code underlying this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In this notebook, swap out the data in the code for the data you plan to use for your project from the `Data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Some of the code will take a long time to execute. The `*` on the left side of the cell will indicate that the cell is still running. The nice thing about preprocessing is that once we have the pipeline complete, we will save our results so we don't need to re-run these cells.\n",

    "## Phrase modeling with Gensim\n",
    "\n",
    "Many kinds of NLP methods work better when using **N-grams**. An n-gram treats small groups of words as tokens rather than single words. This allows words that frequently appearing together to be concatenated (e.g. \"new york\" means something different and more specific than \"new\" and \"york\" separately). Most commonly, a **bigram** = 2-word phrases and a **trigram** = 3-word phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phrase modeling** is an approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaningful multi-word concepts. So rather than treating every pair of words as a n-gram, we look for pairs that occur together frequently and identify those as n-grams. This constrains the token space by limiting the number of multi-word tokens, but requires information about what words co-occur together frequently, which is where **phrase models** come in. We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our lemmatized dataset and looking for words that co-occur (i.e., appear one after another) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim’s [`Phrases`](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html) model implements bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams, etc. `Phrases` detects phrases based on collocation counts. It builds a model of input text that you then can use on other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim detects a bigram if a scoring function for two words exceeds a threshold. The two important arguments to `Phrases` are `min_count` and `threshold`. The higher the values of these parameters, the harder it is for words to be combined to bigrams. We can change the value of these parameters to fine-tune our model. Try changing `min count` and `threshold` below. How does that change the output?"

    "Congratulations! You now have the ability to preprocess text data into trigrams and save the output. This gives us clean text that we can then use in our further analysis. This notebook can be used as a primer for preprocessing data and for further reference. However, once our text is processed and the DataFrame saved to a .csv, all we have to do for our next step in the analysis is to load that processed .csv file, rather than having to re-run these models every time we work with the dataset."
